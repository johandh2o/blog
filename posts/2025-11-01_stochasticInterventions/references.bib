It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research.},

abstract = {Most questions in social and biomedical sciences are causal in nature: what would happen to individuals, or to groups, if part of their environment were changed? In this groundbreaking text, two world-renowned experts present statistical methods for studying such questions. This book starts with the notion of potential outcomes, each corresponding to the outcome that would be realized if a subject were exposed to a particular treatment or regime. In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including, matching, propensity-score methods, and instrumental variables. Many detailed applications are included, with special focus on practical aspects for the empirical researcher.}

	abstractnote = {\&lt;p\&gt;Some of the most prominent results in causal inference have been developed in the context of atomic interventions, following the semantics of the \&lt;em\&gt;do\&lt;/em\&gt;-operator and the inferential power of the \&lt;em\&gt;do\&lt;/em\&gt;-calculus. In practice, many real-world settings require more complex types of interventions that cannot be represented by a simple atomic intervention. In this paper, we investigate a general class of interventions that covers some non-trivial types of policies (conditional and stochastic), which goes beyond the atomic class. Our goal is to develop general understanding and formal machinery to be able to reason about the effects of those policies, similar to the robust treatment developed to handle the atomic case. Specifically, in this paper, we introduce a new set of inference rules (akin to \&lt;em\&gt;do\&lt;/em\&gt;-calculus) that can be used to derive claims about general interventions, which we call \ensuremath{\sigma}-calculus. We develop a systematic and efficient procedure for finding estimands of the effect of general policies as a function of the available observational and experimental distributions. We then prove that our algorithm and \ensuremath{\sigma}-calculus are both sound for the tasks of identification (Pearl, 1995) and z-identification (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012) under this class of interventions.\&lt;/p\&gt;}
